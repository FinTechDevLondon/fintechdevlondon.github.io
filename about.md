Who is Fin Tech?

### More Information

I am a Software Engineer working for a FinTech in London, hence the name FinTechDevLondon. I am a bit of a Scott Meyers type of person in that I am as interested in the language theory as I am the realized software solutions to problems. At least I assume Scott Meyers is interested in theoretical aspects of the C++ language - he has written several books on the subject.

### Can You Employ Me?

Maybe - although I am quite happy working where I am now, I am not against hearing about new opportunities. If you have a project which is genuinely interesting and involves some deep aspects of technical software design, then I would be interested to hear about it. Please don't approach me with "we need someone to type on a keyboard" type jobs.
